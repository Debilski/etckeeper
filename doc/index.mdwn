etckeeper is a collection of tools to let /etc be stored in a git,
mercurial, darcs, or bzr repository. It hooks into package managers such as
apt to automatically commit changes made to /etc during package upgrades.
It tracks file metadata that revison control systems do not normally
support, but that is important for /etc, such as the permissions of
`/etc/shadow`. It's quite modular and configurable, while also being simple
to use if you understand the basics of working with revision control.

For details, see the [[README]].
