Hi, I wrote emails and a bugreport for this issue but never got an answer...

Currently eetckeeper does ignore the .hgignore file. My workflow is like this:
I have a hgignore to ignore everything and adding files explicitly. There are also exceptions from that where I want to track for new files:

Ignoring everyhing would be:
    
    syntax: glob
    **

With exceptions:

    syntax: regexp

    # Ignore anything in root folder but include .hgignore and special folders:
    #^(?!.hgignore|data|DATA|NFS|usr(/local(/lib(/site_perl|$)|$)|$)|etc(/init.d(/*.sh$|$)|$))
    # OR
    ^(?!boot(/config|$)|etc(/runlevels|$))

The long time problem is that etckeeper tries to scan the whole repo root which is / here because I also track some items in /usr/local or /root. Those find on / take far too long and never come back.

Therefore I dropped pre-commit.d/20warn-problem-files completely since I know which files I added explicitly. I also dropped the search for empty directories because I only add specific files.
As for 30store-metadata I added hg status -nacu for getting all relevant files:

Thanks for the new website beside the very basic debian bugtracker. Please provide a bug tracker or ticket system. Please provide also simple tar-balls with the release-versions beside git-tags, that can be used by other package managers and distributions.

Since some distros are already considered please integrate the Gentoo package manager so we can drop our patches:

<http://sources.gentoo.org/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi/gentoo-x86/sys-apps/etckeeper/files/etckeeper-1.15-gentoo.patch>


Best regards,
Massimo
