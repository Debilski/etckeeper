* use debconf for the pre-apt prompting, so it will work better when run from
  frontend like synaptic
* keep an origin branch with the files debian ships
  
  Not sure quite how to do this yet, it seems it would need to clone
  the repo, switch to origin, and commit, then push back to /etc,
  and either merge origin or commit a second time.
  And do this after apt runs only, of course.

  Of coure, unless etckeeper is installed by debootstrap or thereabouts,
  you won't have a true pristine origin branch.
