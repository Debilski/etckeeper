etckeeper (0.14.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix typo in bzr-precommit script. Closes: #473069
    This is an interim fix -- full bzr precommit support has been implemented,
    but the bzr that supports it is not yet released.
  * Fix handling of files with spaces, by setting IFS to NL.

etckeeper (0.14) unstable; urgency=low

  * When deleting the .metadata, only $VCS rm it if using git. hg write
    locks the repo when the pre-commit hook is running, so it would lock.

etckeeper (0.13) unstable; urgency=low

  * Drop the debconf prompt before committing in pre-install.
    Closes: #470577, #462161, #471157, #462161
  * Stop using metastore, instead add shell commands to .etckeeper
    to handle permissions. Patch by Scott Bronson. The main advantages
    of this approach are:
    - .etckeeper uses less disk space than .metadata.
    - Git diff includes changes to the commands in the file, which is more
      transparent than a change to the binary .metadata file, and does not
      produce conflicts during merging.
    - Revision control directories such as .hg are filtered out.
      Closes: #471371
    Note that repositories still including .metadata files will be
    automatically transitioned, and the file removed. Also, etckeeper init
    on a historical version of a repository that still contains .metadata
    will use it, if metastore is installed.
  * Keep track of what packages change state during an installation,
    and include that in the commit message at the end. Closes: #459384

etckeeper (0.12) unstable; urgency=low

  * Use git ls-files instead of git status. Depend on new enough git for this.
  * Add support for bzr, thanks to Mark A. Hershberger. Closes: #470515
    (Note that bzr does not support etckeeper's pre-commit hook.)

etckeeper (0.11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add lvm cache dir to default ignores. (#462355)
  * Updated German translation. Closes: #463153
  * Some initial rpm support. Patch from Евгений Терешков.
  * Add apt hooks for rpm based systems.
  * Add nologin to default ignores.

etckeeper (0.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Convert the directory parameter of etckeeper into "-d directory".
  * Pass other patameters on from etckeeper to the .d scripts.
  * Stop using run-parts for various reasons.
  * Split out a commit.d that contains committing code that's used by
    both the pre-install.d and post-install.d scripts.
  * Split out an unclean.d that tests if the WC contains uncommitted
    changes.
  * Don't commit in post-install.d if there are no uncommitted changes.
  * German debconf translation. Closes: #460940, #458751
  * Use git status instead of git-status (missed this one before).

etckeeper (0.9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Separate debconf use from the main flow of the script so the commit
    stage can use editors etc. Closes: #459547
  * Remove the hint about setting -e to get interactive commits, since
    I don't want to encourage users to do that. (For one thing, it's unlikely
    to work if a graphical package manager is used..)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon, 07 Jan 2008 13:46:22 -0500

etckeeper (0.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Typo fixes from Miklos Vajna

etckeeper (0.7) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * Added configuration options for highlevel and lowlevel package managers
    in etckeeper.conf.
  * Only install apt hooks if apt is used.
  * Only add backup conffile exclusion to gitignore if dpkg is used.

    to be used for other package managers.
  * Use the name of the highlevel package manager in commit messages.
  * Add gnarly conffile renaming code.
  * Support mercurial as an alternative to git. Original patch by Mathieu
    Clabaut, significantly changed.

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * Commit removed files in the pre-install hook to git, as was already done
    for hg. Avoided changing the debconf template so bubulle doesn't murder
    me; the current wording is just vague enough to still work with the
    current behavior.
