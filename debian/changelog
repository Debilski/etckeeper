  * Add vim .*.sw? files to default ignores.
  * Also add emacs #*# autosave files to default ignores.
  * And DEADJOE files, for good measure.
  * etckeeper update-ignore will automatically update the VCS ignore
    file, only touching the part inside a "# managed by etckeeper"
    comment block. (You may want to add such a comment block to your existing
    .gitignore, or delete the file and regenerate it.)
  * Run etckeeper update-ignore on upgrade.
  * Fix handling of -d in recursive calls to etckeeper

  * Swedish debconf translation from Martin Ågren. Closes: #492063
  * Make etckeeper init -d set up commit hooks that call etckeeper -d.
    (Note that if you've relied on it setting up such commit hooks for a repo
    outside of /etc already, it created broken ones that need to be fixed to use
    -d.)

  * When deleting the .metadata, only $VCS rm it if using git. hg write
    locks the repo when the pre-commit hook is running, so it would lock.

  * Drop the debconf prompt before committing in pre-install.
    Closes: #470577, #462161, #471157, #462161
  * Stop using metastore, instead add shell commands to .etckeeper
    to handle permissions. Patch by Scott Bronson. The main advantages
    of this approach are:
    - .etckeeper uses less disk space than .metadata.
    - Git diff includes changes to the commands in the file, which is more
      transparent than a change to the binary .metadata file, and does not
      produce conflicts during merging.
    - Revision control directories such as .hg are filtered out.
      Closes: #471371
    Note that repositories still including .metadata files will be
    automatically transitioned, and the file removed. Also, etckeeper init
    on a historical version of a repository that still contains .metadata
    will use it, if metastore is installed.
  * Keep track of what packages change state during an installation,
    and include that in the commit message at the end. Closes: #459384

    changes.
  * Don't commit in post-install.d if there are no uncommitted changes.

  * Commit removed files in the pre-install hook to git, as was already done
