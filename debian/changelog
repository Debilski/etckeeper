etckeeper (0.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Convert the directory parameter of etckeeper into "-d directory".
  * Pass other patameters on from etckeeper to the .d scripts.
  * Stop using run-parts for various reasons.
  * Split out a commit.d that contains committing code that's used by
    both the pre-install.d and post-install.d scripts.
  * Split out an unclean.d that tests if the WC contains uncommitted
    changes.
  * Don't commit in post-install.d if there are no uncommitted changes.
  * German debconf translation. Closes: #460940, #458751
  * Use git status instead of git-status (missed this one before).

etckeeper (0.9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Separate debconf use from the main flow of the script so the commit
    stage can use editors etc. Closes: #459547
  * Remove the hint about setting -e to get interactive commits, since
    I don't want to encourage users to do that. (For one thing, it's unlikely
    to work if a graphical package manager is used..)

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * Added configuration options for highlevel and lowlevel package managers

  * Only install apt hooks if apt is used.
  * Only add backup conffile exclusion to gitignore if dpkg is used.

  * Commit removed files in the pre-install hook to git, as was already done
    for hg. Avoided changing the debconf template so bubulle doesn't murder
    me; the current wording is just vague enough to still work with the
    current behavior.
