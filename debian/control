Description: store /etc in git or mercurial
 The etckeeper program is a tool to let /etc be stored in a git or mercurial
 repository. It hooks into APT to automatically commit changes made to /etc
 during package upgrades. It uses 'metastore' to track file metadata that
 version control systems do not normally support, but that is important for
 /etc, such as the permissions of /etc/shadow. It's quite modular and
 configurable, while also being simple to use if you understand the basics of
 working with version control.
