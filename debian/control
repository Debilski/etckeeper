Description: store /etc in git, mercurial, or bzr
 The etckeeper program is a tool to let /etc be stored in a git, mercurial,
 or bzr repository. It hooks into APT to automatically commit changes made to
 /etc during package upgrades. It tracks file metadata that
 version control systems do not normally support, but that is important for
 /etc, such as the permissions of /etc/shadow. It's quite modular and
 configurable, while also being simple to use if you understand the basics of
 working with version control.
